description: A simple variable sized record.
with:
  - Interfaces
preamble: |
  -- Define a byte with a restricted range.
  subtype Limited_Byte is Interfaces.Unsigned_8 range 0 .. 250;
  -- Define an array with index ranging from -15 to 4.
  type Buffer_Type is array (Integer range -15 .. 4) of Limited_Byte;
fields:
  - name: Length
    type: Interfaces.Unsigned_8
    format: U8
  - name: Buffer
    type: Buffer_Type
    # Define the proper array format, 20 unsigned bytes
    format: U8x20
    # Define the default value as all zeros.
    default: "[others => 0]"
    # Define the length field that controls the "used" length of this field
    variable_length: Length
    # Optional - provide a signed integer that will be added to the length
    # field to determine the actual value to use as the "used" length
    # of the variable field. This will almost always be zero, but some
    # protocols, notably CCSDS, require this value to be 1.
    variable_length_offset: 0
