description: This is an example component with an base package initialization.
connectors:
  - type: Tick.T
    # Any component with an asynchronous connector requires an internal queue.
    # The sizing of this queue (in bytes) is done during the initialization
    # of the base package in the init_base procedure.
    kind: recv_async
    description: This connector provides the schedule tick for the component.
  - type: Packet.T
    kind: send
    description: This connector is used to send out a telemetry packet.
    # A count of zero specifies this connector as "unconstrained" it must
    # be constrained at runtime by allocating its size on the heap during
    # initialization. This is achieved in the init_base procedure.
