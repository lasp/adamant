   -- Set Up Procedure
   ---------------------------------------
   -- Null method which can be implemented to provide some component
   -- set up code. This method is generally called by the assembly
   -- main.adb after all component initialization and tasks have been started.
   -- Some activities need to only be run once at startup, but cannot be run
   -- safely until everything is up and running, ie. command registration, initial
   -- data product updates. This procedure should be implemented to do these things
   -- if necessary.

   -- Invokee connector primitives:
   ---------------------------------------
   -- This connector provides the schedule tick for the component.

   -- Invoker connector primitives:
   ---------------------------------------
