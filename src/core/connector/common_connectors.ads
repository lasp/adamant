   -- This package contains definitions for commonly employed connectors in the
   -- Adamant system. The purpose of this package is to consolidate instantiation
   -- of these generic packages into a single place that can be used by multiple
   -- component. Doing this provides a huge savings on the resulting code size
   -- of the compiled binary, by not duplicating generic connector instantiations.
