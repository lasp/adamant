-- This package contains a collection of protected objects that attach to interrupts. Each protected interrupt
-- handler object has different properties which might make it better suited for a certain job. Each interrupt
-- handler object receives a custom interrupt handler procedure (written by the user) which is called whenever
-- an interrupt is received. This handler is provided an in out parameter of the generic type T. This entire
-- package is generic, such that the user can instantiate it with the desired data type to be passed between their
-- user written interrupt handler procedure and the protected object itself. In this way, this package provides
-- a thread-safe pattern for handling interrupts while offering enough type flexibility to be used for any
-- foreseeable interrupt handling pattern. If your pattern doesn't fit with one of the protected types below
-- consider adding a new type to the package to grow the collection to meet more use cases.
