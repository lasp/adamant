-- This is an unprotected priority queue data structure. Insertion and removal
-- time from the queue is O(log n). The priority queue uses an internal stable
-- heap data structure to determine the order items are poppped from the queue.
-- Higher priority items leave the queue first. Items of equal priority leave
-- the queue in FIFO order.
--
-- The queue stores both a generic priority type, which can also contain other user
-- meta data. The user of this generic data type must also specify an Greater_Than
-- and Equal_To function to compare priorities. Note that this priority type is
-- often copied during a push or pop operation, so the type should be kept as small
-- as possible.
--
-- Along side the priority type, the queue also stores a byte array of data that can
-- be up to some maximum length defined at init. Internally this data is only copied
-- twice, once during push, and once during pop, for efficiency.
--
-- This data structure is unprotected and has no synchronization mechanism, so should
-- only be used by a single task, or be made protected before used by multiple tasks.
-- See the Protected_Priority_Queue for a synchronized, protected implementation that
-- uses this data structure.
