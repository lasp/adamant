-- This is a protected (thread safe) queue that supports the pushing,
-- popping, and peaking of variable sized byte arrayes or typed queue
-- elements.
--
-- This queue is identical to the Variable_Queue package
-- except that each element is stored with a generic label. The most obvious
-- use for this label is to store information regarding the type of the element
-- stored in the queue, such that the correct deserialization method can be called
-- to decode the data. However, the label can really be any statically sized
-- type. If you use a variable length type as the label, the maximum size of that
-- variable length type will be stored, so this is not recommended.

   -- Status types:
   --
   -- There are many status types because the different functions below can fail in different
   -- ways. Instead of encompassing these in a single, bloated type, a type is created for each
   -- so the called only has to handle the error cases the pertain to the function they are
   -- calling.
   --
   -- Here is a general description of the enumeration literals:
   --
   -- Success   - The operation succeeded
   -- Too_Full - The queue is too full for the push to succeed
   -- Empty      - The queue is empty and no items can be popped from it.
   -- Error      - An unexpected runtime program error occurred. Deeper investigation is required
   --                  if this error is returned.
   -- Serialization_Failure - The type could not be converted to a byte array for storage onto the
   --                                     queue because it is malformed.
   -- Deserialization_Failure - The bytes stored on the queue could not be converted to the destination
   --                                        type because the bytes make the type illegal (Constraint_Error).
