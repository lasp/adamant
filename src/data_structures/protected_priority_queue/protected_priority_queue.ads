-- This is an protected, synchronized priority queue data structure that supports
-- pushing, popping and peeking of variable sized byte arrays of different
-- priorities. Note that this is simply a protected wrapper with synchronization
-- logic (waiting and signaling) on top of the Priority_Queue package.
--
-- Insertion and removal
-- time from the queue is O(log n). The priority queue uses an internal stable
-- heap data structure to determine the order items are poppped from the queue.
-- Higher priority items leave the queue first. Items of equal priority leave
-- the queue in FIFO order.
--
-- The queue stores both a generic priority type, which can also contain other user
-- meta data. The user of this generic data type must also specify an Greater_Than
-- and Equal_To function to compare priorities. Note that this priority type is
-- often copied during a push or pop operation, so the type should be kept as small
-- as possible.
--
-- Along side the priority type, the queue also stores a byte array of data that can
-- be up to some maximum length defined at init. Internally this data is only copied
-- twice, once during push, and once during pop, for efficiency.
