   -- This is the a base type for many other data structures which use
   -- a byte array buffer as their central functioning. This type is pretty
   -- useless on its own. It can be instantiated, deleted, and queried for
   -- meta data, but no access to the internal buffer is granted the user.
   -- Look at inheriting packages for better data structures to use. The
   -- purpose of this package is solely to consolidate shared code and thus
   -- ease of implementation and testing of the inherting data structures.
