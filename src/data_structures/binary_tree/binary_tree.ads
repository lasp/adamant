--
-- Generic binary tree package which has O(n) insertion/removal time and
-- O(log n) search time.
--
-- This binary tree package is optimized to have the fastest look
-- up time possible. It uses a sorted array of elements under the
-- hood so lookups only require integer related math to determine
-- the next index to look at, as opposed to actually traversing
-- the elements of a tree. As a result, insertions take a while because
-- the tree must remain sorted. Insertions may require a lot of
-- copies, moving elements around in the underlying array to ensure
-- the sorted property. As such, this tree is best used when insertions
-- only need to occur once at program startup, and during the rest of
-- the program execution, only look ups are used.
--
-- Removal of elements is done in a similar way to insertion, and takes
-- O(n) time.
--
-- If you need fast insertion/removel time into the binary tree, you should
-- not use this binary tree package, as these operations could get cripplingly
-- slow as the value of N gets very large.
--
-- To instantiate the generic binary tree you must define the type as
-- well as two functions the compare "less than" and "greater than" of
-- the type and return a boolean stating whether the condition is
-- True or False.
