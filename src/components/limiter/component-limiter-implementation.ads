-- Limiter Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Command;
with Parameter;
with Protected_Variables;

-- This is the limiter component. This component receives a generic type of data and queues that data. It then meters the output of the data theourh a "send" connector at a commandable rate. The rate is set upon initialization, can be changed by command, or by parameter. The command or parameter connections may be ommitted if these features are not used.

   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:
   --------------------------------------------------
   -- This initialization function is used to set a threshold for the maximum number of data sends that the component will produce when a tick is received.
   --
   -- Init Parameters:
   -- max_Sends_Per_Tick : Interfaces.Unsigned_16 - The maximum number of sends that this component will produce when a tick is received. The component will stop producing packets if the threshold is met or when the queue is empty, whichever happens first.

   -- can be changed synchronously by command, or by parameter update on two different
   -- tasks.

   -- Set Up Procedure
   ---------------------------------------
   -- Null method which can be implemented to provide some component
   -- set up code. This method is generally called by the assembly
   -- main.adb after all component initialization and tasks have been started.
   -- Some activities need to only be run once at startup, but cannot be run
   -- safely until everything is up and running, ie. command registration, initial
   -- data product updates. This procedure should be implemented to do these things
   -- if necessary.
   overriding procedure Set_Up (Self : in out Instance);

   ---------------------------------------
   -- Invokee connector primitives:
   ---------------------------------------
   -- This is the base tick for the component.
   overriding procedure Tick_T_Recv_Sync (Self : in out Instance; Arg : in Tick.T);
   -- The generic asynchronous invokee connector.
   overriding procedure T_Recv_Async (Self : in out Instance; Arg : in T);
   -- This procedure is called when a T_Recv_Async message is dropped due to a full queue.
   overriding procedure T_Recv_Async_Dropped (Self : in out Instance; Arg : in T);
   -- This is the command receive connector.
   overriding procedure Command_T_Recv_Sync (Self : in out Instance; Arg : in Command.T);
   -- The parameter update connector. This does not need to be connected if the parameter for this component will not be used.
   overriding procedure Parameter_Update_T_Modify (Self : in out Instance; Arg : in out Parameter_Update.T);

   -----------------------------------------------
   -- Description:
   --    These are the commands for the limiter component.
   -- Set a new value for the maximum number of sends this component will produce per tick.

   -- Parameter primitives:
   -----------------------------------------------
   -- Description:
   --    Parameters for the Limiter component.

   -- Invalid parameter handler. This procedure is called when a parameter's type is found to be invalid:

   -- This procedure is called when the parameters of a component have been updated. The default implementation of this
   -- subprogram in the implementation package is a null procedure. However, this procedure can, and should be implemented if
   -- something special needs to happen after a parameter update. Examples of this might be copying certain parameters to
   -- hardware registers, or performing other special functionality that only needs to be performed after parameters have
   -- been updated.
