-- Memory_Packetizer_Fixed_Id Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Memory_Packetizer_Types;
with Command;
with Ada.Real_Time;

-- This active component receives memory pointer information on an asynchronous queue. It then reads the data that these pointers reference into packets, producing multiple maximum sized packets, if necessary, to packetize the entire memory region. This component is similar to the Memory Packetizer except that all packets produced have the same packet ID, assigned to this component at initialization. This component ignores the ID field found in the Memory_Dump_Recv_Sync connector.
package Component.Memory_Packetizer_Fixed_Id.Implementation is

   -- The component class instance record:
   type Instance is new Memory_Packetizer_Fixed_Id.Base_Instance with private;

   --------------------------------------------------
   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:
   --------------------------------------------------
   -- This initialization function is used to set a threshold for the maximum number of packets that the component will produce in a single time period. A time period is measured in an integer number of seconds.
   --
   -- Init Parameters:
   -- max_Packets_Per_Time_Period : Natural - The maximum number of packets that this component will produce in a single second. The component will stop producing packets if the threshold is met, until the end of a second period has elapsed.
   -- time_Period_In_Seconds : Positive - The time period in seconds over which the measure the number of packets produced.

   -- Set Up Procedure
   ---------------------------------------
   -- Null method which can be implemented to provide some component
   -- set up code. This method is generally called by the assembly
   -- main.adb after all component initialization and tasks have been started.
   -- Some activities need to only be run once at startup, but cannot be run
   -- safely until everything is up and running, ie. command registration, initial
   -- data product updates. This procedure should be implemented to do these things
   -- if necessary.
