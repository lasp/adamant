-- Ccsds_Subpacket_Extractor Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Invokee Connector Includes:
with Ccsds_Space_Packet;

-- This component extracts CCSDS formatted subpackets from a larger CCSDS formatted packet. This component can receive packets either synchronously, or asynchronously and can be made either active or passive depending on the desired use case.
package Component.Ccsds_Subpacket_Extractor.Implementation is

   -- The component class instance record:
   type Instance is new Ccsds_Subpacket_Extractor.Base_Instance with private;

   --------------------------------------------------
   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:
   --------------------------------------------------
   -- The component extracts CCSDS subpackets from the data section of a larger CCSDS packet. The init function allows the component to ignore the first, n, or last, m, number of bytes during extraction. This might be useful to ignore a leading secondary header or a trailing checksum.
   --
   -- Init Parameters:
   -- start_Offset : Natural - The number of bytes past the primary CCSDS header to start extracting subpackets from.
   -- stop_Offset : Natural - The number of bytes at the end of CCSDS packet (calculated using the primary header length field) to not extract subpackets from. This value should be used to ignore X number of bytes at the end of a packet.
   -- max_Subpackets_To_Extract : Integer - The maximum number of subpackets to attempt to extract from an incoming packet. A negative number indicates that there is no upper limit to the amount of subpackets that can be extracted. A value of zero disables any subpacketization, which might be useful to disable this component during testing.
