description: This component receives CCSDS packets, validates the data within them, and converts them into Adamant commands. Note that the only internal state that this component contains is a packet accept and packet reject count. The component assumes that only a single task is attached to its CCSDS Space Packet invokee connector, and thus these counters are unprotected. If more than one task is attached to the input, a race condition arises around the counters, which may need to become protected.
