-- Connector_Protector Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- This is a generic component that can be used to protect (as in protected object) the call to the input connector. The component serves as a multi-tasking safe synchronization point for multiple callers. When the T_Recv_Sync connector is called, the component immediately calls the T_Send connector, passing through any arguments. The T_Send connector is called from within a protected object, and so its execution is automic with respect to other callers of T_Recv_Sync. That is, the call to T_Send will finish before another task is allowed to invoke T_Recv_Sync (and thus T_Send). The protection mechanism effectively makes all downstream connector calls of this component thread-safe. The advantage of this component is that deploying it appropriately in an assembly can provide thread-safety to components which are not designed to be thread-safe in and of themselves.
