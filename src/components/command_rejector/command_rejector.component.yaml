description: This component is initialized with a list of commands to reject. The component receives commands, and checks their IDs against the reject command list. If a command is found in the list, then it is dropped and reported as an error packet. Commands that are not on the reject list are always forwarded. The reject command list is stored internally as a binary tree data structure that can determine if a command should be rejected or not in O(log(n)) time, where n is the number of commands to reject. Since most systems only manage a handful of commands on the reject list, the performance of this component should be acceptable for most missions. A common application for this component is to actively disallow commands eminating from certain sources, such as an onboard command sequence.
