description: This is the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Master component. This component implements the master portion of the protocol. Any PTP slaves can use the messages from this component to measure their system time relative to the master, or use the master to synchronize their clocks. Additional documentation on the PTP protocol can be found in the doc/research/ directory for this component.

  parameters:
    - name: Sync_Period
      type: Positive
      default: "1"
      description: The number of ticks between sending precision time protocol messages.
    - name: Enabled_State
      type: Ptp_State.Ptp_State_Type
      default: "Ptp_State.Enabled"
      description: Is precision time protocol enabled or disabled by default at startup.
connectors:
  - description: Tick input that is used to calculate time message frequency. The sync_period can be used to set how many ticks should be received before the master clock starts the update process.
    type: Tick.T

  - description: The command receive connector.
    type: Command.T
    kind: recv_async
  - description: Used to receive the Delay_Request messages from PTP slaves. These messages can be timestamped with their receive time by a component external to this system. If not timestamped (ie. seconds and microseconds set to zero) the component will timestamp the messages as it receives them. This timestamp will be relayed back to the slaves in a Delay_Response message.
    type: Ptp_Time_Message_Receive.T
    kind: recv_async
  - description: Receives and forwards the PTP time for a follow-up message (if connected). The time received is an accurate time stamp of when the Sync message was sent. This time can be provided to this component by a lower level component which actually records the time the Sync message leaves the system. If left unconnected, then no follow-up message will be sent by this component. In this case the PTP slave should use the timestamp provided in the Sync message instead of the follow-up message.
