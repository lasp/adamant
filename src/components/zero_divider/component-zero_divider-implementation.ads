-- Zero_Divider Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Command;

-- The purpose of this component is to provide a safe, commandable way to cause the Ada Last Chance Handler to be called. To accomplish this, this component provides a Divide_By_Zero command which divides an integer by zero, which causes an Ada exception to be thrown, which is purposely not handled. The Divide_By_Zero command must be passed a magic number as an argument. If the magic number does not match the number that this component is instantiated with at initialization, then the Divide_By_Zero is not executed. This feature prevents inadvertant execution of this command.
package Component.Zero_Divider.Implementation is

   -- The component class instance record:
   type Instance is new Zero_Divider.Base_Instance with private;

   --------------------------------------------------
   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:
   --------------------------------------------------
   -- The magic number is provided at instantiation.
   --
   -- Init Parameters:
   -- magic_Number : Magic_Number_Type - Pick a number that must be provided with the Divide_By_Zero command for it to be executed. If any other number is provided, the command is failed and no divide by zero instruction is executed. Note - The values of 0 and 1 are not accepted as magic numbers.
   -- sleep_Before_Divide_Ms : Natural - The number of milliseconds to sleep after receiving the command but before performing the divide by zero. This allows time for any events to be written by the component, if desired.

   -- safely until everything is up and running, ie. command registration, initial
   -- data product updates. This procedure should be implemented to do these things
