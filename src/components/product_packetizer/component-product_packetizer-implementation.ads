-- Standard Includes:
-- Invokee Connector Includes:

with Command;
with Product_Packet_Types;

-- The product packetizer requests data products from an external component and packetizes them into packets at a configurable rate. The packets that this component produces is configured via an autocoded table.

package Component.Product_Packetizer.Implementation is

   -- The component class instance record:
   -- This component requires a list of packet descriptions which outline the packets that the component is responsible for building.
   --
   -- Discriminant Parameters:
   -- packet_List : Product_Packet_Types.Packet_Description_List_Access_Type - The list of packets to packetize.

   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:
   --------------------------------------------------
   -- This initialization function is used to initialize the roll-over value for the packetizer's internal counter. It is calculated as the largest 32-bit multiple of all the provided periods in the packet_List. This ensures that no packets are skipped or sent too often when a rollover occurs. Note, that this only guarantees expected roll-over behavior if the period of the packets are not changed during runtime via command. If this happens, then the user accepts that a rollover may cause unwanted behavior.

   -- The component class instance record:
   -- This component requires a list of packet descriptions which outline the packets that the component is responsible for building.

   -- Discriminant Parameters:
   -- packet_List : Product_Packet_Types.Packet_Description_List_Access_Type - The list of packets to packetize.
