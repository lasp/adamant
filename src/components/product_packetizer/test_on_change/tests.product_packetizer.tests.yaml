  - name: Test_On_Change_Used_For_On_Change_False
    description: This unit test tests that data products with used_for_on_change set to False do not trigger packet emission in on-change mode.
  - name: Test_Enable_Packet_On_Change_Command
    description: This unit test tests the Enable_Packet_On_Change command to dynamically switch a packet to on-change mode and verifies the correct event is emitted.
  - name: Test_On_Change_Multiple_Changes
    description: This unit test tests multiple data product changes over time to verify emission time tracking works correctly.
  - name: Test_On_Change_With_Period
