  This component produces a packet holding the queue current percent usage and maximum usage (high water mark) for each queued component in a particular assembly. It is provided an autocoded data structure upon initialization that contains the queued components that it will monitor. The component is designed to operate on a lower priority rate group running in the background.
execution: passive
init:
