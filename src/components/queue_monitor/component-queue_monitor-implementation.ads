-- Queue_Monitor Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Tick;
with Protected_Variables;

-- This component produces a packet holding the queue current percent usage and maximum usage (high water mark) for each queued component in a particular assembly. It is provided an autocoded data structure upon initialization that contains the queued components that it will monitor. The component is designed to operate on a lower priority rate group running in the background.
package Component.Queue_Monitor.Implementation is

   -- The component class instance record:
   type Instance is new Queue_Monitor.Base_Instance with private;

   --------------------------------------------------
   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:
   --------------------------------------------------
   -- This component requires a list of components whose queues it needs to monitor.
   --
   -- Init Parameters:
   -- queued_Component_List : Component.Component_List_Access - A list of components to monitor.
   -- packet_Period : Interfaces.Unsigned_16 - The period (in ticks) of how often to send out the queue usage packet. A value of zero disable sending of the packet.

   ---------------------------------------

   -- set up code. This method is generally called by the assembly
   -- main.adb after all component initialization and tasks have been started.
   -- Some activities need to only be run once at startup, but cannot be run
   -- safely until everything is up and running, ie. command registration, initial
   -- data product updates. This procedure should be implemented to do these things
   -- if necessary.

   -- This is the command recieve connector.
