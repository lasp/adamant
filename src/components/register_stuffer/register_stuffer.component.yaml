description: This component services commands to stuff and dump registers. This component is different than the memory stuffer/dumper in that it atomically sets 32-bit little endian registers, which is a requirement on some hardware. It rejects commands to stuff or dump addresses that are not on a 4-byte boundary. Note that this component assumes all registers it accesses are little endian. Another version of this component needs to be used to access registers that are big endian.
