description: |
  This component produces a packet holding the CPU execution time for all tasks and interrupts configured for a particular assembly. It is provided an autocoded data structure upon initialization that contains the tasks and interrupts which it is to monitor. The packet produced contains 3 CPU execution numbers (1 bytes in size ranging from 0 - 100) for each task/interrupt, corresponding to different length time periods. The length of these time periods is also specified at initialization as multiples of the master tick driving the component.

  Note that this component monitors CPU utilization by calling the Ada runtime Ada.Execution_Time.Clock subprogram which returns the amount of time since startup that a task or interrupt has been running on the CPU. The input to this subprogram is a Ada.Task_Identification id, which is provided by Adamant in an autocoded global variable for every modeled task which is passed into this component upon initialization. This interface is nonstandard, in that it exchanges information without the use of a connector. However, the use of this nonstandard interface improves efficiency and avoids having to include task identification connectors for every active component, which would be overly cumbersome.
