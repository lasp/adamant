-- Cpu_Monitor Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Tick;
with Ada.Real_Time;
with Ada.Execution_Time;
with Packet;
with Protected_Variables;

-- This component produces a packet holding the CPU execution time for all tasks and interrupts configured for a particular assembly. It is provided an autocoded data structure upon initialization that contains the tasks and interrupts which it is to monitor. The packet produced contains 3 CPU execution numbers (1 bytes in size ranging from 0 - 100) for each task/interrupt, corresponding to different length time periods. The length of these time periods is also specified at initialization as multiples of the master tick driving the component.

   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:

   -- This component requires a list of interrupts and tasks ids to monitor.

   -- Init Parameters:
   -- task_List : Task_Types.Task_Info_List_Access - A list of task info records to monitor.
   -- interrupt_List : Interrupt_Types.Interrupt_Id_List_Access - A list of task info records to monitor.
   -- execution_Periods : Execution_Periods_Type - The period (in ticks) that specify the duration of time that each CPU measurement is taken over.
   -- packet_Period : Interfaces.Unsigned_16 - The period (in ticks) of how often to send out the cpu execution packet. A value of zero disable sending of the packet.
