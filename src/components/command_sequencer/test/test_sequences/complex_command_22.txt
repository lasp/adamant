seq complex_command_22
  ;
  ; Simple sequence that just sends a series of commands with complex arguments on after the other.
  ;

  ; First let's do it with variables.
  declare a u8
  set $a = 3; numeric value for Green
  declare b f32
  set $b = -3.33
  declare c i16
  set $c = 30
  cmd Component_A.Command_4 A $a B $b C $c
  cmd Component_A.Command_4 A $a B -3.33 C $c
  cmd Component_A.Command_4 A Green B $b C $c
  cmd Component_A.Command_4 A $a B $b C 30

  ; Now let's try it statically.
  cmd Component_A.Command_4 A Red B 0 C 0
  cmd Component_A.Command_4 A Red B 2.22 C 17
  cmd Component_B.Command_4 A Green B -2.22 C 1
  cmd Component_A.Command_4 A Blue B 0.5 C 12

  ; Try the second command.
  cmd Component_A.Command_5 A True B -14 C 989
  cmd Component_A.Command_5 A False B 12 C 0
  set $a = 1
  set $c = 44
  declare d i32
  set $d = -13
  cmd Component_A.Command_5 A True B -13 C 44
  cmd Component_A.Command_5 A True B -13 C $c
  cmd Component_A.Command_5 A $a B -13 C 44
  cmd Component_A.Command_5 A True B $d C 44
  cmd Component_A.Command_5 A $a B $d C $c
endseq
