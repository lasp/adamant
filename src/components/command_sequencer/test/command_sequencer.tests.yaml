    description: This unit test tests loading and running a sequence that executes a conditional on a data product that is malformed.
  - name: Test_Sequence_Telemetry_Compare_Corner_Cases
    description: This unit test tests a few corner cases related to telemetry comparisons and makes sure they behave as intended.

    description: This unit test tests loading and running a sequence that loads a sequence into any engine when no engines are available.
  - name: Test_Data_Product_Fetch_Error
    description: This unit test tests loading and running a sequence that executes a conditional on a data product that is not available or has an unknown ID.
  - name: Test_Relative_And_Absolute_Wait_Sequence
    description: This unit test tests loading and running a simple sequence with relative and absolute waits.
  - name: Test_Sequence_Load_Error
    description: This unit test tests all the error conditions associated with a bad sequence load.

    description: This unit test tests changing the summary packet period by command.
  - name: Test_Command_Invalid_Engine
    description: This unit test exercises commands send to invalid engine IDs and makes sure they do not execute.
  - name: Test_Invalid_Command
    description: This unit test exercises that an invalid command throws the appropriate event.

    description: This unit test tests the set engine arguments command.
  - name: Test_Return_Val
    description: This unit test tests the return value feature.
  - name: Test_Bad_Float
    description: This unit test tests what happens when a floating point sequence variable overflows.
  - name: Test_Complex_Command
    description: This unit test tests to make sure commands with complex arguments are formed correctly by the sequencer.

    description: This unit test tests a telemetry fetch when the telemetry item never becomes available.
  - name: Test_Sub_Seq_Load_Timeout
    description: This unit test tests when a sub sequence load fails due to timeout.
