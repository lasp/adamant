-- The Command Sequencer component executes command sequences with a configurable number of engines. The sequence engines execute sequences in the LASP Awesome Sequence Engine Language (LASEL) compiled by the LASP SEQ tool. Documentation on LASEL is included in this component's doc/ directory.
--
-- This component runs a configurable number of sequence engines using a single Adamant task. The task runs each engine in priority order, where lower numbered engines take precendence over higher numbered engines. Each engine contains a configurable-sized stack that allows sequences to call subsequences. This component adheres to the property that commands are only executed after previous commands have completed (ie. a command response has been received). In this way the sequences are largely event driven, waiting on the execution of previous commands to finish prior to executing subsequent ones. A periodic tick is supplied to the component to provide timing control for sequences that need to execute relative or absolute waits, or check until a telemetry condition has been met before proceding.
--
-- The sequence engine and LASEL interpreter is located in the seq/ directory.
