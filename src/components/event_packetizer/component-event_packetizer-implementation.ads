-- Standard Includes:
-- Invokee Connector Includes:
with Tick;
with Event;
with Command;

-- The Event Packetizer component receives events synchronously and places them into a packet. This component receives a periodic tick. A packet is sent out upon receiving a tick if 1) the component has a full packet to send or 2) a partial packet timeout has occurred and the component has a packet with at least one event in it.
