  The Sequence Store component is responsible for storing and managing access to a set of memory regions (slots) which each hold a single sequence. The managed memory regions are usually located in nonvolatile storage and can be read or written to via this component. Sequences are uploaded to slots and then accessed via sequence ID. Sequences can be activated (allowed to be fetched) or deactivated (not allowed to be fetched) by command. The component enforces that all activated sequences have unique IDs. The component will disallow the activation of a sequence if it shares an ID with an already activated sequence.

  -- Type to hold an array of memory regions. Each represents a slot to hold
  -- a single sequence of equal or smaller size (including header and meta data).
  type Sequence_Slot_Array is array (Sequence_Store_Types.Slot_Number range <>) of Memory_Region.T;
  type Sequence_Slot_Array_Access is access all Sequence_Slot_Array;

  description: The component is initialized by providing the memory regions (slots) it is to manage.
  parameters:
    - name: Sequence_Slots

      not_null: true
      description: "A list of memory regions. Each represents a slot to hold a single sequence of equal or smaller size (including header). This list will be copied into the component at initialization onto a heap allocated memory. The memory regions must not overlap in any way, must be large enough to at least hold a sequence header, and the list must not be empty. These properties will be enforced by the component via assertions when Init is called."

      type: Boolean
      description: "If True, then check the validity of the sequences in all slots by computing CRCs over them at startup."

      type: Boolean
      description: "If True, then the slot summaries will be dumped at startup."
