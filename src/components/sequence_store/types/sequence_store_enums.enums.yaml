description: These are enumerations that are used to interact with the Sequence Store component.
enums:
  - name: Sequence_Store_Status
    description: This status enumeration provides information on the success/failure of a sequence store operation.
    literals:
      - name: Success
        value: 0
        description: Sequence was successfully stored.
      - name: Invalid_Slot_Number
        value: 1
        description: The slot number does not exist within the component.
      - name: Slot_In_Use
        value: 2
        description: The operation could not be completed because the destination slot is currently active.
      - name: Crc_Error
        value: 3
        description: The computed CRC of the sequence does not match the stored CRC.
      - name: Length_Error
        value: 4
        description: The sequence length was too large to store in the selected slot.
      - name: Dropped
        value: 5
        description: The operation could not be performed because it was dropped from a full queue.
  - name: Sequence_Fetch_Status
    description: This status enumeration provides information on the success/failure of a sequence fetch operation.
    literals:
      - name: Success
        value: 0
        description: Sequence was successfully returned.
      - name: Id_Not_Found
        value: 1
        description: A sequence with the provided ID was not found in the store.
  - name: Slot_State_Type
    description: This enumeration determines the state of a sequence slot in the store.
    literals:
      - name: Inactive
        value: 0
        description: The slot is inactive and the contained sequence cannot be fetched.
      - name: Active
        value: 1
        description: The slot is active and the contained sequence can be fetched.
  - name: Slot_Valid_Type
    description: This enumeration determines the valid state of a sequence slot in the store based on a calculated CRC of the sequence.
    literals:
      - name: Unchecked
        value: 0
        description: The CRC of the sequence in the slot has not been checked for validity.
      - name: Valid
        value: 1
        description: The CRC of the sequence in the slot has been checked for validity and matches the stored CRC in the sequence header.
      - name: Invalid
        value: 2
        description: The CRC of the sequence in the slot has been checked for validity and does not match the stored CRC in the sequence header.
      - name: Undefined
        value: 3
        description: This is an invalid enumeration value. However, since this is represented in 2-bits and read from MRAM, it is possible that this could occur should the memory be corrupted, or never properly initialized. To keep the type unconstrained we need to include this value.
