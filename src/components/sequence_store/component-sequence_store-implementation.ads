   -- The component is initialized by providing the memory regions (slots) it is to manage.
   --
   -- Init Parameters:
   -- Sequence_Slots : Sequence_Slot_Array_Access - A list of memory regions. Each represents a slot to hold a single sequence of equal or smaller size (including header). This list will be copied into the component at initialization onto a heap allocated memory. The memory regions must not overlap in any way, must be large enough to at least hold a sequence header, and the list must not be empty. These properties will be enforced by the component via assertions when Init is called.
   -- Check_Slots_At_Startup : Boolean - If True, then check the validity of the sequences in all slots by computing CRCs over them at startup.
   -- Dump_Slot_Summary_At_Startup : Boolean - If True, then the slot summaries will be dumped at startup.
