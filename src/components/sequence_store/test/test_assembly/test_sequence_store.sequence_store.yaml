# Optional - Description of sequence store
description: This is an example sequence store layout.
# Required - A list of slots that the store should manage. These
# slots should not overlap in any way. Overlap will be checked for
# within the component Init.
slots:
  # Required - Address of first slot. This may be a numerical address
  # or a reference to a variable defined elsewhere. It is recommended
  # to use this model in conjunction with the memory_map model to
  # enforce no overlap.
  - address: Test_Slots.Slot_0_Memory'Address
  # Required - Length of first slot. This may be a numerical length
  # or a reference to a variable defined elsewhere. It is recommended
  # to use this model in conjunction with the memory_map model to
  # enforce no overlap.
    length: Test_Slots.Slot_0_Memory'Length
  - address: Test_Slots.Slot_1_Memory'Address
    length: Test_Slots.Slot_1_Memory'Length
  - address: Test_Slots.Slot_2_Memory'Address
    length: Test_Slots.Slot_2_Memory'Length
  - address: Test_Slots.Slot_3_Memory'Address
    length: Test_Slots.Slot_3_Memory'Length
