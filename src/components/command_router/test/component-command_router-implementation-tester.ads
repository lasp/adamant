-- The Command Router component receives incoming commands and routes them to the appropriate component for execution. Commands IDs are registered by components connected to the command router on initialization. These registrations are used to populate a router table (binary tree) which is used to translate incoming Command IDs to their destination component. When a command is received by the Command Router, its ID is looked up in the table, which returns the connector index on which the destination component is attached. The Command Router will then forward the command out of the appropriate index. Event errors are thrown if a Command ID is not found in the table.
--
-- In addition to routing commands the Command Router also receives command responses from the downstream components who execute commands. These responses are used to report data products on the command success and failure counts. Responses can also be forwarded to the sourcing command components, allowing command sources to check command responses or wait until a command response is received before sending a subsequent command.
--
-- The Command Router also has some of its own internal NOOP commands, to which it responds with Events. These commands can be useful for testing system aliveness.
--
-- It is advised to connect one index of the Command_T_Send connectors to the Command Router's own Command_T_Recv_Async connector in order to utilize the NOOP commands to enable self testing of command routing. Likewise, it is advisable to connect the Command Router's Command_Response_T_Send to the Command_Response_T_Recv_Async connector and one index of the Command_Response_T_To_Forward_Send connector to the Command_Response_T_Recv_Async connector in order to fully utilize the component's ability to self test command response forwarding (see the Noop_Response command).
