--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Command;

-- The memory dumper component is an active component that can dump memory regions or report the CRC of memory regions by command. It reports an error if an action is requested on a memory region outside of the address space that it is configured with during initialization.

   -- The component class instance record:
   type Instance is new Memory_Dumper.Base_Instance with private;

   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:
   --------------------------------------------------
   -- This component requires a list of memory regions which it can dump and CRC.
   --
   -- Init Parameters:
   -- memory_Regions : Memory_Manager_Types.Memory_Region_Array_Access - An access to a list of memory regions.

   --    These are the commands for the Memory Dumper component.
   -- Dump a region of memory starting at a given address and of a given length.
   overriding function Dump_Memory (Self : in out Instance; Arg : in Memory_Region_Positive.T) return Command_Execution_Status.E;
   -- Perform a CRC on a region of memory starting at a given address and of a given length. The CRC will be reported via event and data product, if those connectors are connected.
   overriding function Crc_Memory (Self : in out Instance; Arg : in Memory_Region_Positive.T) return Command_Execution_Status.E;

   -- Invalid command handler. This procedure is called when a command's arguments are found to be invalid:
