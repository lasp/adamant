-- The Task Watchdog component receives pets from components that execute in a periodic manner throughout the assembly. The receipt of a pet indicates that the component is running well and is what is refered to as a watchdog. If it detects that the component has stopped executing for some configurable time, called a limit, it will either ignore the fault, throw a warning event, or throw a fault and possibly stop servicing an downstream watchdog (usually a hardware watchdog) based on the component's configuration. The configuration is dependent on the input list generated from a yaml model for this component. The input requires a connector name, a limit for the number of ticks without a pet, the criticality of the component, and the action to take if the limit is exceeded which is one of the three described before.
-- In addition, the criticality of the task is also defined in the yaml model which determines if the watchdog component stops petting the downstream watchdog.
