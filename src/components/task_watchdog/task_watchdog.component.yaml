  The Task Watchdog component receives pets from components that execute in a periodic manner throughout the assembly. The receipt of a pet indicates that the component is running well and is what is referred to as a watchdog. If it detects that the component has stopped executing for some configurable time, called a limit, it will either ignore the fault, throw a warning event, or throw a fault and possibly stop servicing a downstream watchdog (usually a hardware watchdog) based on the component's configuration. The configuration is dependent on the input list generated from a yaml model for this component. The input requires a connector name, a limit for the number of ticks without a pet, the criticality of the component, and the action to take if the limit is exceeded which is one of the three described before.
  In addition, the criticality of the task is also defined in the yaml model which determines if the watchdog component stops petting the downstream watchdog.
