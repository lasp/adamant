-- The Task Watchdog component receives pets from components that execute in a periodic manner throughout the assembly. The receipt of a pet indicates that the component is running well. If it detects that the component has stopped executing for some configurable time, it will throw a warning event, a fault, or stop servicing an downstream watchdog (usually a hardware watchdog) based on the component's configuration.
