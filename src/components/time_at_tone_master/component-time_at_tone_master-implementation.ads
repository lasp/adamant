-- Time_At_Tone_Master Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Tick;
with Command;
with Protected_Variables;
with Ada.Real_Time;
with Interfaces;

-- This is the Time at Tone Master component. TaT is a protocol used to sync a slave clock to a master clock. Two messages are sent from the master to the slave component. First a 'time at tone' message is sent which provides the slave clock with the time that should be stuffed to its clock when the tone message is received. Then a tone message is sent at the appropriate time and the slave clock is updated. This component implements the master side of the protocol. This component outputs the time message and the tone as Tick.T send connectors. This design is intended to be generic enough to implement time at tone in many different manners on the other end of these connectors. For instance, you could convert the time message Tick.T to a CCSDS packet and the tone Tick.T to a GPIO pulse.

   -- wait_Time_Ms : Natural - Number of milliseconds the master waits between the sending of the time message and the sending of the tone message. This is implemented internally by an Ada 'delay until' statement.
   -- sync_Period : Positive - The number of ticks between sending clock sync messages.
   -- enabled_State : Tat_State.Tat_State_Type - Is time at tone enabled or disabled by default at startup.
