-- Last_Chance_Manager Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Command;

-- The purpose of this component is to manage a region of non-volatile memory where the last chance handler saves exception information, should one be thrown. This component provides commands to dump this region of memory and reset the contents of the memory to all zeros. The component provides a data product that reports the first address of the stack trace, which can be used as confirmation that the LCH got called (if the value is nonzero). This component also supplies the packet definition for the assembly for a LCH packet that is created by the last chance handler itself (which is not usually implemented as an Adamant component). This provides the ground system the LCH packet definition so it can be parsed and stored.

   type Instance is new Last_Chance_Manager.Base_Instance with private;

   -- This component requires the memory region which the last chance handler data will be stored.

   -- Init Parameters:
   -- Exception_Data : Packed_Exception_Occurrence.T_Access - The copy of the exception data that is updated by the last chance handler, presumably in a nonvolatile memory region.
   -- Dump_Exception_Data_At_Startup : Boolean - If True, then the exception data will be dumped in packet at startup.
