description: The purpose of this component is to manage a region of non-volatile memory where the last chance handler saves exception information, should one be thrown. This component provides commands to dump this region of memory and reset the contents of the memory to all zeros. The component provides a data product that reports the first address of the stack trace, which can be used as confirmation that the LCH got called (if the value is nonzero).
