description: The Interrupt Listener allows an attached component to ask if an interrupt has occurred and receive any data that was gathered during the interrupt handling. This component contains an internal piece of data (of generic type) which is set in a custom interrupt procedure passed in at instantiation. External components can request the latest version of this data at any time. A common use for this component might be to manage a counter, where the custom procedure increments the count with each interrupt, and the requester of the data uses the count to determine if an interrupt has been received.

  - Interrupt_Handlers
generic:
  description: The Interrupt Listener is parameterized by the Interrupt_Data_Type. The instantiation of this type is often determined by what data needs to be collected during an interrupt and how a connected component intends to process that data. This type is a user defined type that is passed into the user's custom interrupt handler as an in-out parameter and then passed to a downstream components out of the Interrupt_Data_Type_Return connector. Usually, this type will be used to capture data related to an interrupt in the interrupt handler.
  parameters:
    - name: Interrupt_Data_Type
      description: The user's custom datatype that is set in the custom interrupt handler and then passed to downstream components. If you do not foresee needing to collect specific data in the interrupt handler for the downstream component, consider using the Tick.T type, which includes a timestamp and a count.
