-- Connector_Counter_16 Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Command;
with Protected_Variables;

-- This generic component attaches to a connector and counts the invocations occurring on that connector. It then reports this count as a data product and passes the connector invocation through to a connected component on the other side. The count rolls over at 65535 and is 2 bytes wide.
generic
package Component.Connector_Counter_16.Implementation is

   type Instance is new Connector_Counter_16.Base_Instance with private;

   -- Set Up Procedure
   ---------------------------------------
   -- Null method which can be implemented to provide some component
   -- set up code. This method is generally called by the assembly
   -- main.adb after all component initialization and tasks have been started.
   -- Some activities need to only be run once at startup, but cannot be run
   -- safely until everything is up and running, i.e. command registration, initial
   -- data product updates. This procedure should be implemented to do these things
   -- if necessary.
   overriding procedure Set_Up (Self : in out Instance);

   -- Invokee connector primitives:
   ---------------------------------------
   -- The generic invokee connector.

   -- The command receive connector.

   ---------------------------------------
   -- This procedure is called when a T_Send message is dropped due to a full queue.

   -- This procedure is called when a Data_Product_T_Send message is dropped due to a full queue.

   -- This procedure is called when a Event_T_Send message is dropped due to a full queue.
   overriding procedure Event_T_Send_Dropped (Self : in out Instance; Arg : in Event.T) is null;
   -- This procedure is called when a Command_Response_T_Send message is dropped due to a full queue.

   --    These are the commands for the component.
   -- This command resets the internal count.
