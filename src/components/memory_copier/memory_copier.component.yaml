description: This component services a command to copy from one memory region to another. The to/from destination of the copy command is determined by how it is connected in the assembly. The component will wait a configurable timeout for the copy command to complete before failing the command and reporting a timeout error.
execution: active
init:
  description: Initialization parameters for the Memory Copier.
  parameters:
    - name: Ticks_Until_Timeout
      type: Natural
      description: The component will wait until it has received at least this many ticks before reporting a timeout error while waiting for a memory copy to complete. For example, if the component is attached to a 10Hz rate group and this value is set to 7, then the component will wait between 700 and 800 ms before declaring a timeout error from an unresponsive downstream component.
