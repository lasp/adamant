-- Memory_Copier Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Tick;
with Command;
with Protected_Variables;
with Task_Synchronization;

-- This component services a command to copy from one memory region to another. The to/from destination of the copy command is determined by how it is connected in the assembly. The component will wait a configurable timeout for the copy command to complete before failing the command and reporting a timeout error.
package Component.Memory_Copier.Implementation is

   type Instance is new Memory_Copier.Base_Instance with private;

   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:

   -- Initialization parameters for the Memory Copier.
   --
   -- Init Parameters:
   -- ticks_Until_Timeout : Natural - The component will wait until it has received at least this many ticks before reporting a timeout error while waiting for a memory copy to complete. For example, if the component is attached to a 10Hz rate group and this value is set to 7, then the component will wait between 700 and 800 ms before declaring a timeout error from an unresponsive downstream component.

   -- Create a protected object that holds a memory region release. This will be set synchronously
   -- by the responses the downstream component, and will be read by this
   -- component, so must be protected to prevent corruption.

   -- safely until everything is up and running, ie. command registration, initial
   -- data product updates. This procedure should be implemented to do these things
   -- if necessary.
