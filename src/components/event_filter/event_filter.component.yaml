description:
  The Event Filter component is used to filter out event IDs. The component takes in a range of IDs valid for filtering and an initial list of event IDs to filter.
  The filter utilizes a specific package to hold all of the ID and associated states. The package will determine if a ID needs to be filtered or not and return that to the component.
  The component will then either forward the event or perform no action if it is a filtered event. The component also has the capability to change the state of a single event ID, a range of event IDs, and a global state for turning off filtering all together.
  In this case the state of filtering for each ID will be maintained for when the master state is set back to enabled. Lastly, there is a packet that contains all the bit information of each ID's state and can be dumped by command.
