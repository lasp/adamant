-- Forwarder Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Command;
with Protected_Variables;
with Basic_Enums;

-- This is a generic component that can be used to forward a single connector of any type. The component that synchronously forwards any type that it receives. It includes commands to enable or disable this forwarding, so can be effectively used as a stream on/off switch.

   --------------------------------------------------

   -- Init Parameters:
   -- Startup_Forwarding_State : Basic_Enums.Enable_Disable_Type.E - Is the data stream enabled or disabled on startup. Disable means that the component does not forward any data it receives at startup.

   -- Set Up Procedure
   ---------------------------------------
   -- Null method which can be implemented to provide some component
   -- set up code. This method is generally called by the assembly
   -- main.adb after all component initialization and tasks have been started.
   -- Some activities need to only be run once at startup, but cannot be run
   -- safely until everything is up and running, ie. command registration, initial
   -- data product updates. This procedure should be implemented to do these things
   -- if necessary.
