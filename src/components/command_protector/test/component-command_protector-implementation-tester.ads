-- This component is initialized with a list of protected commands. The component receives commands, and checks their IDs against the protected commands list. If a command is found in the list, then it is only forwarded if the component has been 'armed', otherwise the command is dropped and an error packet is produced with the rejected command data. Commands that are not on the protected commands list are always forwarded. To 'arm' the component, a special 'arm' command must be sent to the component to transition it to the 'armed' state. At this point, a protected command may be successfully forwarded. Note that after the receipt of any command, the component will transition back to the 'unarmed' state, rejecting any subsequently received protected commands until another 'arm' command is received. The component will also transition back to the 'unarmed' state after a timeout expires, which is set in the 'arm' command itself. The protected command list is stored internally as a binary tree data structure that can determine if a command is protected or not in O(log(n)) time, where n is the number of protected commands. Since most systems only manage a handful of protected commands, the performance of this component should be acceptable for most missions.
