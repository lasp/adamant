-- The component manages access to a single memory location through a single pointer. When requested, the component loans out access to the pointer if it is available. The length of the pointer will always be the entire length of the memory region. The component will reject any requests to access the pointer again until the pointer is returned from the requestor. Request/release memory transactions are each provided a unique ID. To release the memory, the same ID must be provided that was issues upon request. This mechanism reduces the risk of an inadvertant call to release from causing an unintended release of the memory. The component includes a data product relating whether the memory is currently allocated or not. The component responds to commands to CRC, dump, write, and force-release the memory region. Note that this component is active only to provide a seperate thread of execution on which to execute the CRC command and the memory write command, each which could take a long time to execute.
