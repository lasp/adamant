-- Standard Includes:
with Component.Tick_Divider_Reciprocal;
with History;
with Sys_Time;

-- Invokee Connector Includes:
with Tick;
with Event;

-- Events Includes:
with Td_Full_Queue_Param;

-- The Tick Divider component is a simple component which has an invokee port meant to be called at a periodic rate. This invokee port will usually be connected to a component which services a periodic hardware tick, or the Ticker component, which simulates a hardware tick. The Tick Divider takes this periodic rate and divides it into subrates which are divisions of the original rate. These divisors are provided via an init routine.
