-- Memory_Stuffer Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Command;
with Memory_Region_Copy;
with Arm_State;

-- The memory stuffer component is an active component that can stuff (write to) memory regions. It reports an error if an action is requested on a memory region outside of the address space that it is configured with during initialization.
package Component.Memory_Stuffer.Implementation is

   -- The component class instance record:
   type Instance is new Memory_Stuffer.Base_Instance with private;

   --------------------------------------------------
   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:
   --------------------------------------------------
   -- This component requires a list of memory regions which it can write to. These regions can either be protected (requiring and arm command prior to execution) or unprotected, as specified by the second parameter.
   --
   -- Init Parameters:
   -- Memory_Regions : Memory_Manager_Types.Memory_Region_Array_Access - An access to a list of memory regions.
   -- Memory_Region_Protection_List : Memory_Manager_Types.Memory_Protection_Array_Access - An access to a list of the protected/unprotected state of each memory region. The index in this array corresponds to the index of the memory region affected in the previous parameter. If the array is null, then it is assumed that all memory regions are unprotected.

   -- main.adb after all component initialization and tasks have been started.
   -- Some activities need to only be run once at startup, but cannot be run
   -- safely until everything is up and running, ie. command registration, initial
   -- data product updates. This procedure should be implemented to do these things
   -- if necessary.
