-- Ccsds_Serial_Interface Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Ccsds_Space_Packet;
with Ada.Task_Identification;

-- This component is meant to be a backdoor serial component which uses Ada.Text_IO to send a receive data over a serial port. On Linux, this will send/recv data to/from the terminal, but Ada.Text_IO is attached to a diagnostic uart on most embedded systems. This means that this component can be used as a quick and dirty serial interface without implementing hardware specific uart drivers.

package Component.Ccsds_Serial_Interface.Implementation is

   -- Sync pattern for serial. Made public so it can be used elsewhere.
   Sync_Pattern : constant Basic_Types.Byte_Array := (0 => 16#FE#, 1 => 16#D4#, 2 => 16#AF#, 3 => 16#EE#);

   overriding procedure Ccsds_Space_Packet_T_Recv_Async (Self : in out Instance; Arg : in Ccsds_Space_Packet.T);
   -- This procedure is called when a Ccsds_Space_Packet_T_Recv_Async message is dropped due to a full queue.
   overriding procedure Ccsds_Space_Packet_T_Recv_Async_Dropped (Self : in out Instance; Arg : in Ccsds_Space_Packet.T) is null;

   ---------------------------------------
   -- This procedure is called when a Ccsds_Space_Packet_T_Send message is dropped due to a full queue.
   overriding procedure Ccsds_Space_Packet_T_Send_Dropped (Self : in out Instance; Arg : in Ccsds_Space_Packet.T) is null;

   -- Definition of subtasks functions for task execution:
   -------------------------------------------------------
   -- This internal task is used to listen on the serial port for incomming packets.
   -- IMPORTANT: This component needs an inner task to run the
   -- following function as if it were the "cycle" method of
   -- a normal component. The "cycle" method of this component
   -- acts in the normal way, blocking on the component
   -- queue, waiting for messages to send through the serial port.
   -- The special cycle method below should be run on another
   -- task to block on the serial port, waiting for incoming messages
   -- which it will then send out to the rest of the assembly.
   -- This task should be set to the LOWEST priority, since it spin
   -- locks while waiting for data on the serial port in many
   -- bare board implementation.
   overriding procedure Listener (Self : in out Instance);
