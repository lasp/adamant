  This component is meant to be a backdoor serial component which uses Ada.Text_IO to send a receive data over a serial port. On Linux, this will send/recv data to/from the terminal, but Ada.Text_IO is attached to a diagnostic uart on most embedded systems. This means that this component can be used as a quick and dirty serial interface without implementing hardware specific uart drivers.
