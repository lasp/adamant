  This component is meant to be a backdoor serial component which uses Ada.Text_IO to send and receive data over a serial port. On Linux, this will send/recv data to/from the terminal, but Ada.Text_IO is attached to a diagnostic uart on most embedded systems. This means that this component can be used as a quick and dirty serial interface without implementing hardware specific uart drivers.
execution: active
subtasks:
  - name: Listener
    description: This internal task is used to listen on the serial port for incoming packets.
init:
  description: Init to provide gap between packets if necessary
  parameters:
    - name: Interpacket_Gap_Ms
      type: Natural
      default: "0"
      description: Amount of time in milliseconds to wait in between transmission of each CCSDS packet. Some UART protocols rely on a gap to differentiate between packets, and this can be used to enforce that.
connectors:
  - description: On this connector the Serial Interface Component receives data and sends it out of the serial port.
    type: Ccsds_Space_Packet.T
    kind: recv_async
  - description: On this connector the Serial Interface Component sends any data it received from the serial port.
    type: Ccsds_Space_Packet.T
    kind: send
  - description: Events are sent out of this connector.
    type: Event.T
    kind: send
  - description: The system time is retrieved via this connector.
    return_type: Sys_Time.T
    kind: get
