-- Ccsds_Product_Extractor Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Binary_Tree;
with Ccsds_Space_Packet;
with Product_Extractor_Types; use Product_Extractor_Types;

-- The product extractor is a component that extracts data from an incoming packet which it then creates into a data product and sends as its own data product for other component use. This is performed by using a list of types that include the offset and the corresponding APID to know which packets to extract from. The data is verified against the respective type at which point it will either send it on or create an event indicating there was an error. All of this information is derived from a user defined YAML input model that contains the information for each data product and the residing packet. See the generator documentation for more information.

   -- safely until everything is up and running, ie. command registration, initial
   -- data product updates. This procedure should be implemented to do these things
   -- if necessary.
