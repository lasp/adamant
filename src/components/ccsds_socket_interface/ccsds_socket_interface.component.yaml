  The Socket Interface Component is an interface component which connects the rest of the assembly to an outside entity (usually the ground system) via a TCP/IP socket. It spawns an internal task to listen to the socket for incoming data. It also provides an asynchronous receive connector which it services on it's task, sending any data it receives out of the socket. The data send and recieve connectors are CCSDS.
