description: The purpose of this component is to provide a safe, commandable way to cause the Ada Last Chance Handler (LCH) to be called. To accomplish this, this component provides a Divide_By_Zero_In_Cpp command which divides an integer by zero in C++. This causes a C++ exception to be thrown which is purposely not handled. The Divide_By_Zero_In_Cpp command must be passed a magic number as an argument. If the magic number does not match the number that this component is instantiated with, then the Divide_By_Zero_In_Cpp command will not execute. This feature prevents inadvertent execution of this command. The usage of this component is dependent on the implementation of a LCH, in addition to a C++ termination handler, configured such that unhandled exceptions thrown in C++ propagate to the LCH. This component is specifically intended for use in testing the LCH implementation. To this end, this component supplies the packet definition for the assembly of a Packed_Exception_Occurrence.T packet that is maintained in the Adamanet Last Chance Manager (LCM) component. It is intended that reporting of the exception information be managed by the LCH using the format established in the LCM Packed_Exception_Occurrence.T packet. This provides the ground system with a standardized exception information packet That can be used for all exceptions that cause the LCH to fire.

  parameters:
    - name: Magic_Number
      type: Magic_Number_Type
      description: Pick a number that must be provided with the Divide_By_Zero_In_Cpp command for it to be executed. If any other number is provided, the command is failed and no divide by zero instruction is executed. Note - The values of 0 and 1 are not accepted as magic numbers.
    - name: Sleep_Before_Divide_Ms
      type: Natural
      description: The number of milliseconds to sleep after receiving the command but before performing the divide by zero. This allows time for any events to be written by the component, if desired.
      default: "1_000"
