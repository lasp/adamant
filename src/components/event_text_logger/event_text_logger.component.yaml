  The Event Text Logger component receives events on an asynchronous queue and prints them either to the terminal or to a file as it receives them. The print statements for events are generated per the assembly that the Event Text Logger is attached to. By pointing the generator to a particular assembly model, you enable it to recognize and print certain events that are present in that assembly.

discriminant:
  description: The discriminant for this component takes an access of type Event_To_Text_Function. The function provided should translate an event to a string for any given event in an assembly. A package with this function implementation is autocoded for each assembly, and can be passed into the Event Text Logger to configure it for a given assembly.
