-- Ccsds_Router Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Invokee Connector Includes:
with Ccsds_Space_Packet;
with Ccsds_Primary_Header;
with Binary_Tree;

-- This component routes CCSDS packets to output connectors based on a static table matching APID to the output connector index. Table lookup is done by binary searching against APID. The look up returns a list of indexes which to route that packet. This component can receive packets either synchronously, or asynchronously and can be made either active or passive depending on the desired use case.

   type Instance is new Ccsds_Router.Base_Instance with private;

   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:
   --------------------------------------------------
   -- This component requires a routing table which maps CCSDS packet APIDs to a list of output connector indexes. This is provided as part of the initialization function.
   --
   -- Init Parameters:
   -- table : Ccsds_Router_Types.Router_Table_Entry_Array - An array of router table entries which include routing and sequence count checking information.
   -- report_Unrecognized_Apids : Boolean - Should the component report unrecognized APIDs by sending out an error packet and event, True, or should it not report them at all, False.
