-- Stack_Monitor Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Tick;
with Command;
with Interfaces;
with Protected_Variables;

-- This component produces a packet holding the stack and secondary stack usage for all tasks configured for a particular assembly. It is provided an autocoded data structure upon initialization that contains the tasks which it is to monitor. The packet produced contains a byte representing the percent usage of the stack and secondary stack for each task. Task usage is recalculated on every tick.

   -- This component requires a list of tasks to monitor.

   -- Init Parameters:
   -- task_List : Task_Types.Task_Info_List_Access - A list of task info records to monitor.
   -- packet_Period : Interfaces.Unsigned_16 - The period (in ticks) of how often to calculate value for and send out the packet. A period of zero disables sending of the packet.

   -- safely until everything is up and running, ie. command registration, initial
   -- data product updates. This procedure should be implemented to do these things
