  This component produces a packet holding the stack and secondary stack usage for all tasks configured for a particular assembly. It is provided an autocoded data structure upon initialization that contains the tasks which it is to monitor. The packet produced contains a byte representing the percent usage of the stack and secondary stack for each task. Task usage is recalculated on every tick.
execution: passive
init:
