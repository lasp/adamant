description: These are the requirements for the PID Controller component.
requirements:
  - text: The PID controller component shall take a measured error input to determine the P, I, and D components of the control.
  - text: The PID controller component shall include a limit to the integral term to avoid controller wind-up.
  - text: The PID controller component shall include a feed-forward term to the controller.
  - text: The PID controller component shall calculate the mean, variance, and max of the error over a specifed sample count.
  - text: The PID controller component shall produce diagnostic packets with subpackets that contain the measured, reference, and the current angle.
  - text: The PID controller component shall output the current control error for control of hardware by other components.
