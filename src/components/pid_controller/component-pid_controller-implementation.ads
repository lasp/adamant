   -- control_Frequency : Short_Float - The frequency in Hz at which the PID controller is being driven. This determines the time step for the PID controller to use in the algorithm.
   -- database_Update_Period : Unsigned_16 - The period in which to update the data products
   -- diagnostic_Stats_Length : Unsigned_16 - The number of diagnostic samples to keep to perform the mean, variance, and max
   -- moving_Average_Init_Samples: Integer - The number of samples to initialize the object with. Must be less than the max, and is optional to set to the max with -1
