-- The Event Limiter takes in events and checks that there have not been too many events of a single ID within one tick that would cause the system to flood with events. Every tick the event counts are decremented to keep events flowing at the appropriate rate. The component takes in a start and stop ID and should include all IDs in that range. The component also takes a list of event ID's to set as disabled by default. All others will be enabled by default.
