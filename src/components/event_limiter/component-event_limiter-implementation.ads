-- Event_Limiter Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Includes:
with Tick;
with Event;
with Command;
with Protected_Variables;
with Two_Counter_Entry;
with Two_Counter_Entry_Enums;

-- The Event Limiter takes in events and checks that there have not been too many events of a single ID within one tick that would cause the system to flood with events. Every tick the event counts are decremented to keep events flowing at the appropriate rate. The component takes in a start and stop ID and should include all IDs in that range. The component also takes a list of event ID's to set as disabled by default. All others will be enabled by default.
package Component.Event_Limiter.Implementation is
   use Two_Counter_Entry_Enums;
   -- The component class instance record:
   type Instance is new Event_Limiter.Base_Instance with private;

   --------------------------------------------------
   -- Subprogram for implementation init method:
   --------------------------------------------------
   --
   -- Init Parameters:
   -- event_Id_Start : Event_Types.Event_Id - The number of packets that the component contains internally. This is the available buffer that the component has to store events. When all packets are exhausted, then the component begins dropping events. The component needs to be at least double buffered, meaning a minimum of two packets need to be allocated.
   -- event_Id_Stop : Event_Types.Event_Id - The number of ticks that can be received before a partial packet timeout occurs. When a partial packet timeout occurs, a packet containing at least one event is sent out, and then the timeout is reset. A value of zero passed for this parameter will disable the partial packet timeout, meaning only full packets are ever sent out of the component.
   -- event_Disable_List : Two_Counter_Entry.Event_Id_List - A list of event IDs that are enabled by default
   -- event_Limit_Persistence : Two_Counter_Entry.Persistence_Type - The inital persistence of the number of events to allow before limiting them between ticks (1 to 7)
