description:
  The Event Limiter is used to limit the number of events in the system for prevention of flooding the system with a single event.
  The component takes in a range of event IDs which sets up a 1-bit enable/disable state and 3-bit counter for each ID, for a total of 4-bits. Any IDs out of that range will not be limited.
  Each event counter monitors how many events have been sent through the component, before it limits from a given persistence value that can be set from 1 to 7.
  Each tick of the system will decrement each of the event counters by 1. At this point, there will be an event issued if any events are at the event limit and the number of events that were dropped. An event listed at the limit does not necessarily mean that any events of that ID were dropped.
  The component itself can be disabled to allow all events through with no limiting, but will maintain the state of each event for when it is re-enabled.
  The user also has the ability to dump all the states of the ID range in a packet. Each ID also has the ability to be disabled or enabled, where disabled will not limit events of that ID.
