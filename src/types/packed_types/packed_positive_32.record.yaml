    description: The 32-bit Positive_32. A Positive_32 is ranged integer type that is the same range as the 32-bit modular unsigned int or Interfaces.Unsigned (starting at 1 instead of zero). Because this is a range type and not a modular type, Ada detects overflow or underflow of the type, which is useful in some situations. This is a subtype of Natural_32.
