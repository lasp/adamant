description: These are enumerations that are used in the Adamant parameter system.
enums:
  - name: Parameter_Operation_Type
    description: This enumeration lists the different parameter operations that can be performed.
    literals:
      - name: Stage
        value: 0
        description: Stage the parameter.
      - name: Update
        value: 1
        description: All parameters are staged, it is ok to update all parameters now.
      - name: Fetch
        value: 2
        description: Fetch the parameter.
      - name: Validate
        value: 3
        description: Validate the parameter.
  - name: Parameter_Update_Status
    description: This status enumeration provides information on the success/failure of a parameter operation.
    literals:
      - name: Success
        value: 0
        description: Parameter was successfully staged.
      - name: Id_Error
        value: 1
        description: Parameter id was not valid.
      - name: Validation_Error
        value: 2
        description: Parameter values were not successfully validated.
      - name: Length_Error
        value: 3
        description: Parameter length was not correct.
  - name: Parameter_Table_Operation_Type
    description: This enumeration lists the different parameter table operations that can be performed.
    literals:
      - name: Get
        value: 0
        description: Retrieve the current values of the parameters.
      - name: Set
        value: 1
        description: Set the current values of the parameters.
      - name: Validate
        value: 2
        description: Validate the current values of the parameters.
  - name: Parameter_Table_Update_Status
    description: This status enumeration provides information on the success/failure of a parameter table update.
    literals:
      - name: Success
        value: 0
        description: Parameter was successfully staged.
      - name: Length_Error
        value: 1
        description: Parameter table length was not correct.
      - name: Crc_Error
        value: 2
        description: The computed CRC of the table does not match the stored CRC.
      - name: Parameter_Error
        value: 3
        description: An individual parameter was found invalid due to a constraint error within a component, or failing component-specific validation.
      - name: Dropped
        value: 4
        description: The operation could not be performed because it was dropped from a full queue.
  - name: Parameter_Validation_Status
    description: This status enumeration provides information on the result of validating a set of parameters.
    literals:
      - name: Valid
        value: 0
        description: Parameters were validated.
      - name: Invalid
        value: 1
        description: Parameters were found to be invalid.
