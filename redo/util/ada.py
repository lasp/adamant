# Every object depends on any specification file (.ads) of a withed package. Figuring out
# which adb file should be depended on is a bit trickier. The ruled are layed out here:
#
#   https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.2/gnat_ugn/Source-Dependencies.html
#
# Rules:
#   1. If a file being compiled with's a unit X, the object file depends on the file containing the spec of unit X.
#      This includes files that are with'ed implicitly either because they are parents of with'ed child units or they
#      are run-time units required by the language constructs used in a particular unit.
#   2. If a file being compiled instantiates a library level generic unit, the object file depends on both the spec
#      and body files for this generic unit.
#   3. If a file being compiled instantiates a generic unit defined within a package, the object file depends on the
#      body file for the package as well as the spec file.
#   4. If a file being compiled contains a call to a subprogram for which pragma Inline applies and inlining is
#      activated with the -gnatn switch, the object file depends on the file containing the body of this subprogram
#      as well as on the file containing the spec. Note that for inlining to actually occur as a result of the use
#      of this switch, it is necessary to compile in optimizing mode.
#   5. The use of -gnatN activates inlining optimization that is performed by the front end of the compiler. This
#      inlining does not require that the code generation be optimized. Like -gnatn, the use of this switch
#      generates additional dependencies.
#
#   When using a gcc-based back end (in practice this means using any version of GNAT other than the JGNAT, .NET
#   or GNAAMP versions), then the use of -gnatN is deprecated, and the use of -gnatn is preferred. Historically
#   front end inlining was more extensive than the gcc back end inlining, but that is no longer the case.
#
#   If an object file O depends on the proper body of a subunit through inlining or instantiation, it depends on the
#   parent unit of the subunit. This means that any modification of the parent unit or one of its subunits affects the
#   compilation of O.
#
#   6. The object file for a parent unit depends on all its subunit body files.
#
#
# The function below provides a conservative implementation of the rules specified above. Adamant does not have support
# for subunits currently, so that portion is ignored. Provided an ada specification file, this function determines if
# you should also depend on the .adb file by determining if the spec:
#
#   1) Includes any library level generic definitions
#   2) Includes any package level generic definitions
#   3) Includes any subprograms that are make use of pragma Inline
#
# These determinations are not quite accurate, but they are conservative. For instance, #1 and #2 really only apply if
# the object that is currently being compiled actually instantiates a generic object. We are not checking if this is
# the case, we just assume it might be since it is withing the package. For #3 we do not check to see if the -gnatn
# or -gnatN switch is being used, we just assume it is. This is also conservative.
#
# Even with this conservative approach, substantial gains in recompilation performance can be seen.
