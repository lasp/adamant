    # This approach, while always producing correctly compiled code, is

    # object code that in reality doesn't actually need to be recompiled.
    # Sometimes this can be slow. To deal with this problem, the following
    # flag was created.
    #
    # When enabled, this flag will only assume dependencies on spec files (.ads).
    # While this is incorrect, about 98% of the time it will be correct. In this
    # case recompilation performance will be much improved. In the 2% chance that
    # the compilation fails, a warning will be displayed to the user by gcc telling
    # them that a file doesn't exist. In this case the user can build this source
    # manually using redo, and continue on their way, or switch the flag off
    # temporarily before switching it back on for the next compile.
    #
    # NOTE about the above: Fast compile is now enabled by default, since now
    # have the capability to detect when we need to depend on .adb files. To
    # disabled fast compile you need to set the SAFE_COMPILE via the commandline.
    #
    # NOTE there are certain times this must be turned off, such as when performing
