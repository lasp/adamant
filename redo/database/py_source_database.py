# This database is responsible for storing python source files found in
# the build path. The database maps the python module name to the source
# code of that module, as well as any model files that
# are used to generate that source code. An example is shown below:
#
# Key:             Value:
# module_name      ([/path/to/module_name.py, \
#                    /path/to/module_name.yaml)
#
# This database is useful for figuring out where python is located
# in the system given just a module name (which is all that is included
# in the import dependencies of a python source file).
