# This database is responsible for storing C/C++ source files found in
# the build path. The database maps the source filename with the extension
# removed to the source code location, as well as any model files that
# are used to generate that source code. An example is shown below:
#
# Key:       Value:
# c_filename ([/path/to/c_filename.c, \
#              /path/to/c_filename.h], \
#              /path/to/some_c_model.yaml)
#
# This database is useful for figuring out where c source is located
# in the system given just a base name (which may be all that is included
# in the "#include" dependencies of a C source file). Note that all
# entries in this database must be uniqe, meaning that C files in the
# build path of the same name, but in different directories are not
# allowed in Adamant, because of the interface with Ada, even though
# this pattern is allowed by the C language specification.

    # passed in source code) only a single .c and a single .h file may be added.
    # If adding another file is attempted, the function will error and warn the user
