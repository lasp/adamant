# Note about this module:
# This module is private in that it exposes no public
# function that are meant to be called externally. The
# exception is database/setup.py, which calls the _setup()
# funtion in this module. The purpose of splitting the two
# modules up is to improve performance. Most of the time
# the setup module is used, it does not need to import all the
# many modules that these function require. By splitting the
# files we avoid spending time doing a lot of unnecessary
# module imports.

# precidence over same-named things in the core framework.
