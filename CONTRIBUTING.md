# How to Contribute

Adamant welcomes any and all contributions! Do you have something to add?

This file provides basic information on how to contribute to the Adamant software framework.

While we encourage all contributions, remember that Adamant is used everyday to create reliable and efficient software for safety-critical applications including spacecraft. As such, code quality is important, and you may be asked to make adjustments to your submission prior to inclusion.

## Creating a Submission

Adamant follows the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) development process. You should begin by [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository. When you have finished making changes on your fork, create a pull request back to this repository.

Please try to keep submissions small and focused on single fixes, enhancements, or additions. This makes changes easier to review and faster to merge.

Once a pull request has been submitted the following will occur:

### Submission Review

All pull requests are reviewed by an Adamant maintainer and the community. Your code may fly in space, and will be held to a high standard. Our maintainers are happy to work with contributors to ensure changes meet these standards. Once the pull request is approved by a maintainer, the submission will be included within the repository.

### Tests and Checks

Adamant leverages [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to unit test and style check the code. These automated checks will be run after a maintainer has reviewed your request. All checks must pass successfully before your pull request can be included.

Note that many of these checks are annoyingly pedantic, but this helps ensure uniformity and quality in the Adamant code base. Adamant maintainers may make commits on your pull request to correct minor issues.

### Approval and Merge

Once the pull request is passing all tests and checks and has been approved by a maintainer it will be merged into the Adamant repository!
