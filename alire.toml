# This alire.toml is used to download the Ada crate dependencies for Adamant.
# The Adamant build system then uses these dependencies via the `alr printenv`
# GPR_BUILD_PATH to compile targets within this repository using `redo`. This
# alire.toml itself only points to a simple hello world program that is compiled
# when using `alire build`.
