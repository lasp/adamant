**Adamant** is a framework that enables efficient design, implementation, and test of embedded real-time software. Adamant was first developed for spacecraft flight software at the [Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)](https://lasp.colorado.edu/) at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and is now available for use under the Apache-2.0 [license](LICENSE). 

Adamant was created to solve two problems:

 1. Provide a technical solution that addresses the unique challenges of spacecraft flight software, with a focus on performance
 2. Allow for direct, verbatim code reuse from project to project to reduce development costs and increase reliability

The framework is used by first creating a model of the software in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) based domain specific language. This model defines a set of components and describes how they are connected together.

This model is used to generate the structural code, documentation, unit test scaffolding, and command & telemetry interface for the system. Developers are then left the task of defining the system behavior via handwritten Ada.

## What is Included

 * A model-based architecture that divides software into separate components with strongly-typed interfaces
 * Generators which can produce code, diagrams, and documentation from these models
 * A platform agnostic, multi-tasking, high performance, embedded real-time software core written in Ada that adheres to the [Ravenscar Profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenscar_profile)
 * Support for compiling and proving [SPARK](https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-spark/chapters/01_Overview.html#what-is-it) (a formally provable subset of Ada)
 * A growing library of ready-to-use [components](src/components)
 * An [AUnit](https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/aunit/html/aunit_cb/aunit_cb.html)-based component test framework
 * Tooling for test coverage, coding style checks, code metrics, and more

## Getting Started

The best way to get started with Adamant is to try out the [Example Project](https://github.com/lasp/example). The example demonstrates a functioning deployment of Adamant that runs on both Linux and an embedded [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) target. The example also provides a docker-based build environment that contains all the dependencies needed for working with Adamant. You are encouraged to clone the example project and begin modifying it to meet your needs.
